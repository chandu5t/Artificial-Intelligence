# ðŸ§  Artificial Intelligence â€“ Practical Assignments in C++

This repository contains a series of practical assignments focused on core Artificial Intelligence concepts, implemented entirely in C++ using Visual Studio Code. Each assignment is designed to reinforce theoretical understanding through hands-on coding.

## ðŸ“Œ What This Repo Covers

Explore foundational AI techniques through modular, well-documented C++ programs. These assignments are ideal for students, educators, and developers aiming to build intelligent systems from the ground up.

## ðŸ§ª Assignments Included

- DFS and BFS for 8-Puzzle Problem  
  Solve the classic tile puzzle using Depth-First and Breadth-First Search algorithms.

- Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)  
  Implement a solver for problems like map coloring using backtracking.

- Family Tree Parsing via Knowledge Base  
  Use logical rules and facts to infer relationships and answer queries.

- A* Algorithm for Application  
  Apply heuristic-based search for optimal pathfinding or puzzle solving.

- Minimax Algorithm for Game Playing  
  Build a decision-making agent for two-player games like Tic-Tac-Toe.

- Basic Search â€“ 8-Queens Problem  
  Solve the N-Queens challenge using backtracking and search strategies.

- Forward Chaining Algorithm  
  Implement rule-based inference to derive conclusions from known facts.

- Backward Chaining Algorithm  
  Construct goal-driven reasoning to determine if a query can be satisfied.

## ðŸ›  Development Setup

Language: C++  
IDE: Visual Studio Code  
Compiler: g++ (recommended via MinGW or GCC)  
Extensions: C/C++ by Microsoft, Code Runner (optional)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/chandu5t/Artificial Intelligence.git

2. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code.

3. Compile and run each assignment using the terminal or Code Runner.

4. Refer to comments in each .cpp file for logic explanation and usage.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Strengthen understanding of AI algorithms through C++ implementation  
- Build reusable, modular code for academic and real-world applications  
- Visualize and explain AI logic clearly for demos and presentations

Happy coding and enjoy building intelligent systems with C++
